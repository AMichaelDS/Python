| [Ass 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v8XjgoSFh7BP_RpDpJkMQZaDoIDk_1ek) |  |  |
| [Financial Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fuU3B29-i5q5fFUVia36pAR4Zgo2nX7s) | Data Analysis, Financial Data | The exercises in this week focused on loading financial data, calculating averages and correlations, and comparing market returns. The tasks were designed to provide insights into key metrics and trends within financial datasets using pandas and numpy libraries. |
| [Momentum Indicators](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eNuF-stLEhPjI6XROjtQFsZHoRwoYys0) | Data Analysis, Momentum Strategies | These exercises explored momentum indicators and their analysis. The projects showcased the application of momentum strategies in the financial domain through data loading, calculation of information coefficients, and examination of performance metrics. |
| [Quantile Analysis and Strategy Evaluation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13FBX-IWqX3Lznw06zP0QiBDSeb-SU7qq) | Data Analysis, Portfolio Management | In this week, the exercises centred around quantile analysis and strategy evaluation. By dividing stocks into groups based on factors like momentum and earnings-to-price ratios and analyzing their performance metrics, the projects highlighted the importance of portfolio diversification and the impact of different factors on investment strategies. |
| [Financial Data Analysis and Statistical Tests](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15yt8l5mxciLP91RbdGnnyFcyj0uUtG24) | Data Analysis, Statistical Testing | These exercises involved analyzing financial data and conducting statistical tests. Tasks included loading and merging datasets, performing t-tests, and backtesting investment strategies. The projects showcased the use of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing in the financial domain. |
| [Predictive Modeling with Decision Tree Regression](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Wp1o4qJ6XSnLxehdsTPi2fbUwtcmixPG) | Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning | The project this week revolved around predictive modelling using decision tree regression. The exercise demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques in forecasting future stock returns by training a model on historical financial data, making predictions, and evaluating performance metrics. Feature selection and model evaluation were emphasized for accurate predictions. |
