## Projects

| Project Link | Project Focus | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| [Artificial Intelligence Capstone - Isolation Forest](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ndBlsvQXI5gdzdWQGDjD1Z9DNMAeX91X?usp=sharing) | Outlier Detection, Dimensionality Reduction, Data Visualization | This project focuses on detecting outliers in insurance data using the Isolation Forest algorithm to uncover potential cases of adverse selection. I enhance the analysis by applying PCA for dimensionality reduction and generating a heatmap to visualize the outliers. Additionally, I integrate a demographic dataset to provide context and create visualizations to explore the demographic characteristics of the identified anti-selector users. |
| [Artificial Intelligence Capstone - Apriori](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FbB2AdVLi72MOtoaT0XORRzYxzfee5YP?usp=sharing) | Association Rule Mining | In this project, I apply the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent item sets and generate association rules. These rules are then used to identify the number of rules breaking for each user, providing insights into potential adverse selection behaviour. The results are combined with demographic data to analyze the demographics of the anti-selector users and gain a deeper understanding of their characteristics. |
| [Advanced Data Analytics - Wine Quality](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VHw0KAdTXJCYDtPK6TdNBeF_oDAbjifn?usp=sharing) | Classification, Decision Trees | This project focuses on implementing a decision tree algorithm to classify wine quality based on various attributes. The decision tree is trained on a wine dataset, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics. Additionally, the decision tree is visualized to understand the decision-making process and gain insights into the important features of wine quality classification. |
| [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xNh5bgJZz-3u50Q-e0LquTD8oehMJX5G) | Data Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization | Task 1 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship, this project involves analyzing a groceries dataset to understand its structure and statistical properties. Using Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn, I perform data loading, descriptive statistics computation, and visualization to gain insights and formulate recommendations for enhanced stock management. The analysis also identifies potential areas for further exploration and additional data requirements. |
| [Model Building and Interpretation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X3MqwI550VbUvPOn0u6Zkx_X3nMG8Lm2) | Data Modeling, Forecasting, Feature Importance | Task 3 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship, this project involves preparing and building a predictive model to forecast product stock levels on an hourly basis. The dataset includes sales, stock levels, and storage temperature information. I perform data preparation steps, create relevant features, train a RandomForestRegressor model, and evaluate its performance. Additionally, I visualize the importance of features using a bar plot. |
| [Machine Learning Production](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jCI2UD7egXU3xBujJgmzaDKlRiRP23_J?usp=sharing) | Model Deployment, Python Module Development | Task 4 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship, this project involves developing a Python module that can read a CSV file and perform data modelling tasks similar to Task 3, which is training a RandomForestRegressor model to forecast product stock levels. The module includes comprehensive comments and documentation to ensure usability by the ML engineering team. |
| [Financial Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hFkIaVYeagi_uMEyi1ag1tHPk-MRUv4O) | Statistical Analysis, Financial Insights | This project involves conducting statistical analysis on financial data, including correlation analysis, quantile analysis, and information coefficient calculation. I explore factors influencing investment strategies, such as quality, profitability, growth, and safety. |
| [Portfolio Optimization](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v8XjgoSFh7BP_RpDpJkMQZaDoIDk_1ek) | Portfolio Management, Backtesting, Performance Metrics | In this project, I implement portfolio management strategies and backtest the Quality factor. I optimize strategies through parameter exploration and calculate performance metrics. Additionally, I conduct stability analysis, walk-forward modelling, and backtest a combined factor with profit, growth, and safety. |
| [Financial Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fuU3B29-i5q5fFUVia36pAR4Zgo2nX7s) | Data Analysis, Financial Data Exploration | These exercises focus on loading financial data, calculating averages and correlations, and comparing market returns. Using libraries like pandas and numpy, I gain insights into key metrics and trends within financial datasets. |
| [Momentum Indicators](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eNuF-stLEhPjI6XROjtQFsZHoRwoYys0) | Data Analysis, Momentum Strategies | These exercises explore momentum indicators and their analysis. The projects showcase the application of momentum strategies in the financial domain through data loading, calculating information coefficients, and examining performance metrics. |
| [Quantile Analysis and Strategy Evaluation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13FBX-IWqX3Lznw06zP0QiBDSeb-SU7qq) | Data Analysis, Portfolio Management | These exercises revolve around quantile analysis and strategy evaluation. By dividing stocks into groups based on factors like momentum and earnings-to-price ratios and analyzing their performance metrics, the projects highlight the importance of portfolio diversification and the impact of different factors on investment strategies. |
| [Financial Data Analysis and Statistical Tests](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15yt8l5mxciLP91RbdGnnyFcyj0uUtG24) | Data Analysis, Statistical Testing | These exercises involve analyzing financial data and performing statistical tests. Tasks include loading and merging datasets, conducting t-tests, and backtesting investment strategies. The projects showcase statistical analysis and hypothesis testing in the financial domain. |
| [Predictive Modeling with Decision Tree Regression](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Wp1o4qJ6XSnLxehdsTPi2fbUwtcmixPG) | Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning | The project revolves around predictive modelling using decision tree regression. I demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in forecasting future stock returns by training a model on historical financial data, making predictions, and evaluating performance metrics. Feature selection and model evaluation are emphasized for accurate predictions. |
