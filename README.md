## Projects

| Project Link | Project Focus | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| [Artificial Intelligence Capstone - Isolation Forest](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ndBlsvQXI5gdzdWQGDjD1Z9DNMAeX91X?usp=sharing) | Outlier Detection | Here I detect outliers in insurance data using the Isolation Forest algorithm to uncover potential cases of adverse selection. I enhance the analysis by applying PCA for dimensionality reduction and generating a heatmap to visualize the outliers. I integrate a demographic dataset with the outlier information to provide additional context. Finally, I create visualizations to explore and understand the demographic characteristics of the identified anti-selector users. |
| [Artificial Intelligence Capstone - Apriori](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FbB2AdVLi72MOtoaT0XORRzYxzfee5YP?usp=sharing) | Association Rule Mining | I apply the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent item sets and generate association rules. These rules are then used to identify the number of breaking rules for each user. The results are combined with demographic data to analyze the demographics of the anti-selector users, providing insights into potential adverse selection behaviour.|
| [Advanced Data Analytics - Wine Quality](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VHw0KAdTXJCYDtPK6TdNBeF_oDAbjifn?usp=sharing) | Classification | In this project, I implement a decision tree algorithm to classify wine quality based on various attributes. The decision tree is trained on a wine dataset, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics. The decision tree is also visualized to understand the decision-making process and gain insights into the important features of wine quality classification. |
| [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xNh5bgJZz-3u50Q-e0LquTD8oehMJX5G) | Data Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualisation | Task 1 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship, I analyzed groceries dataset to understand its structure and statistical properties. By utilizing Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn for data loading, descriptive statistics computation, and visualization, I gained insights and formulated recommendations to enhance stock management for the client. This analysis also identified potential areas for further exploration and any additional data requirements that may be necessary.|
| [Model Building and Interpretation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X3MqwI550VbUvPOn0u6Zkx_X3nMG8Lm2) | Data modelling, forecasting | Task 3 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship, I performed data modelling by preparing and building a predictive model to forecast product stock levels on an hourly basis. The dataset consisted of sales, stock levels, and storage temperature information. I executed data preparation steps, created features, trained a RandomForestRegressor model, and evaluated its performance. Additionally, I visualized the feature's importance using a bar plot. |
| [Machine Learning Production](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jCI2UD7egXU3xBujJgmzaDKlRiRP23_J?usp=sharing) | Model deployment, Python module | Task 4 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship, I developed a Python module that can read a CSV file, perform data modelling tasks similar to Task 3 which is to train a RandomForestRegressor model to forecast product stock levels on an hourly basis. The module includes comprehensive comments and documentation to ensure its usability by the ML engineering team. |
| [Financial Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hFkIaVYeagi_uMEyi1ag1tHPk-MRUv4O) | Statistical Analysis, Financial Insights | Conducted statistical analysis on financial data, including correlation analysis, quantile analysis, and information coefficient calculation. Explored factors influencing investment strategies such as quality, profitability, growth, and safety. |
| [Portfolio Optimization](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v8XjgoSFh7BP_RpDpJkMQZaDoIDk_1ek) | Portfolio Management, Backtesting | Implemented portfolio management strategies and backtested the Quality factor. Optimized strategies through parameter exploration and calculated performance metrics. Conducted stability analysis, walk-forward modelling, and backtested a combined factor with profit, growth, and safety. |
| [Financial Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fuU3B29-i5q5fFUVia36pAR4Zgo2nX7s) | Data Analysis, Financial Data | The exercises this week focused on loading financial data, calculating averages and correlations, and comparing market returns. The tasks were designed to provide insights into key metrics and trends within financial datasets using pandas and numpy libraries. |
| [Momentum Indicators](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eNuF-stLEhPjI6XROjtQFsZHoRwoYys0) | Data Analysis, Momentum Strategies | These exercises explored momentum indicators and their analysis. The projects showcased the application of momentum strategies in the financial domain through data loading, calculating information coefficients, and examining performance metrics. |
| [Quantile Analysis and Strategy Evaluation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13FBX-IWqX3Lznw06zP0QiBDSeb-SU7qq) | Data Analysis, Portfolio Management | In this week, the exercises centred around quantile analysis and strategy evaluation. By dividing stocks into groups based on factors like momentum and earnings-to-price ratios and analyzing their performance metrics, the projects highlighted the importance of portfolio diversification and the impact of different factors on investment strategies. |
| [Financial Data Analysis and Statistical Tests](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15yt8l5mxciLP91RbdGnnyFcyj0uUtG24) | Data Analysis, Statistical Testing | These exercises involved analyzing financial data and conducting statistical tests. Tasks included loading and merging datasets, performing t-tests, and backtesting investment strategies. The projects showcased the use of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing in the financial domain. |
| [Predictive Modeling with Decision Tree Regression](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Wp1o4qJ6XSnLxehdsTPi2fbUwtcmixPG) | Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning | The project this week revolved around predictive modelling using decision tree regression. The exercise demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques in forecasting future stock returns by training a model on historical financial data, making predictions, and evaluating performance metrics. Feature selection and model evaluation were emphasized for accurate predictions. |
