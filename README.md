| [Artificial Intelligence / Analytics Capstone - Isolation Forest for Outlier Detection in Insurance Data](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ndBlsvQXI5gdzdWQGDjD1Z9DNMAeX91X?usp=sharing) | Outlier Detection, Dimensionality Reduction, Data Visualization | In this project, I utilized the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect outliers in insurance data and uncover potential cases of adverse selection. I applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and generated a heatmap to visualize the outliers. Moreover, I integrated a demographic dataset to provide context and created visualizations to explore the demographic characteristics of the identified anti-selector users. |
| [Artificial Intelligence / Analytics Capstone - Apriori Algorithm for Adverse Selection Detection in Insurance](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FbB2AdVLi72MOtoaT0XORRzYxzfee5YP?usp=sharing) | Association Rule Mining, Adverse Selection Detection | For this project, I detect adverse selection in insurance by utilizing the Apriori algorithm. I identified frequent item sets and generated association rules to uncover potential cases of adverse selection. By combining these findings with demographic data, I provided insights into the characteristics and behaviours of anti-selector users, helping to address and mitigate adverse selection in the insurance industry. |
| [Advanced Data Analytics - Wine Quality Classification using Decision Trees](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VHw0KAdTXJCYDtPK6TdNBeF_oDAbjifn?usp=sharing) | Classification, Decision Trees | In this project, I applied a decision tree algorithm to classify wine quality based on various attributes. I evaluated the performance of the decision tree using accuracy metrics and visualized the decision-making process to understand the important features of wine quality classification. |
| [Exploratory Data Analysis of Grocery Transaction Dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xNh5bgJZz-3u50Q-e0LquTD8oehMJX5G) | Data Preparation, Descriptive Statistics, Data Visualization | Task 1 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship. In this project, I analyzed a grocery transaction dataset to uncover its structure and statistical properties. I aimed to gain valuable insights for optimizing stock management practices through thorough data examination, descriptive statistical analysis, and insightful visualizations. The analysis also identified areas for further exploration and potential data requirements to enhance the understanding of the dataset. |
| [Predictive Model for Hourly Product Stock Level Forecasting](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X3MqwI550VbUvPOn0u6Zkx_X3nMG8Lm2) | Data Modeling, Forecasting, Feature Importance | Task 3 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship. In this project, I built a predictive model to forecast product stock levels on an hourly basis. It involved data preparation, creating relevant features, training a RandomForestRegressor model, and evaluating its performance. Additionally, I visualized the importance of features using a bar plot. |
| [Python Module Development for Machine Learning Production](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jCI2UD7egXU3xBujJgmzaDKlRiRP23_J?usp=sharing) | Model Deployment, Python Module Development, Data Processing | Task 4 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship. In this project, I transformed the code from the previous task into a functional Python module capable of reading a CSV file and performing data modelling. The module enabled efficient data processing and accurate prediction of stock levels. It also included comprehensive comments and documentation to ensure usability by the machine learning engineering team. |
