## Projects

| Project Link | Project Focus | Project Description |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| [Artificial Intelligence / Analytics Capstone - Isolation Forest](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ndBlsvQXI5gdzdWQGDjD1Z9DNMAeX91X?usp=sharing) | Outlier Detection, Dimensionality Reduction, Data Visualization | This project utilises the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect outliers in insurance data and uncover potential cases of adverse selection. It applies PCA for dimensionality reduction and generates a heatmap to visualise the outliers. Moreover, it integrates a demographic dataset to provide context and creates visualisations to explore the demographic characteristics of the identified anti-selector users. |
| [Artificial Intelligence / Analytics Capstone - Apriori](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FbB2AdVLi72MOtoaT0XORRzYxzfee5YP?usp=sharing) | Association Rule Mining | This project aims to detect adverse selection in insurance by utilising the Apriori algorithm. It identifies frequent item sets and generates association rules to uncover potential cases of adverse selection. By combining these findings with demographic data, the project provides insights into the characteristics and behaviours of anti-selector users, helping to address and mitigate adverse selection in the insurance industry. |
| [Advanced Data Analytics - Wine Quality](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VHw0KAdTXJCYDtPK6TdNBeF_oDAbjifn?usp=sharing) | Classification, Decision Trees | This project applies a decision tree algorithm to classify wine quality based on various attributes. It evaluates the performance of the decision tree using accuracy metrics and visualises the decision-making process to understand the important features of wine quality classification. |
| [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xNh5bgJZz-3u50Q-e0LquTD8oehMJX5G) | Data Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization | Task 1 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship. This project analyses a grocery transaction dataset to uncover its structure and statistical properties. It aims to gain valuable insights for optimising stock management practices through thorough data examination, descriptive statistical analysis, and insightful visualisations. The analysis also identifies areas for further exploration and potential data requirements to enhance the understanding of the dataset. |
| [Model Building and Interpretation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X3MqwI550VbUvPOn0u6Zkx_X3nMG8Lm2) | Data Modeling, Forecasting, Feature Importance | Task 3 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship. This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast product stock levels on an hourly basis. It involves data preparation, creating relevant features, training a RandomForestRegressor model, and evaluating its performance. Additionally, it visualises the importance of features using a bar plot. |
| [Machine Learning Production](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jCI2UD7egXU3xBujJgmzaDKlRiRP23_J?usp=sharing) | Model Deployment, Python Module Development | Task 4 of the Cognizant Virtual Internship. It involves transforming the code from Task 3 into a functional Python module capable of reading a CSV file and performing data modelling tasks similar to Task 3, specifically training a Random Forest Regressor model for forecasting product stock levels. The module enables efficient data processing and accurate prediction of stock levels. It also includes comprehensive comments and documentation to ensure usability by the machine learning engineering team. |
| [Financial Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hFkIaVYeagi_uMEyi1ag1tHPk-MRUv4O) | Statistical Analysis, Financial Insights | The first assignment of the applied portfolio management subject. This assessment involves conducting statistical analysis of financial data, including correlation analysis, quantile analysis, and calculation of the information coefficient. It explores factors influencing investment strategies, such as quality, profitability, growth, and safety. |
| [Portfolio Optimization](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v8XjgoSFh7BP_RpDpJkMQZaDoIDk_1ek) | Portfolio Management, Backtesting, Performance Metrics | The second assignment of the applied portfolio management subject. It focuses on implementing portfolio management strategies and backtesting the Quality factor. We optimise strategies through parameter exploration and calculate performance metrics. The project also includes stability analysis, walk-forward modelling, and backtesting of a combined factor with profit, growth, and safety. |
| [Financial Data Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fuU3B29-i5q5fFUVia36pAR4Zgo2nX7s) | Data Analysis, Financial Data Exploration | Week 3 Coding Exercise for the applied portfolio management subject. It loads financial data, calculates averages and correlations, and compares market returns. We use fundamental programming techniques to extract valuable insights related to key metrics and trends within financial datasets.|
| [Momentum Indicators](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eNuF-stLEhPjI6XROjtQFsZHoRwoYys0) | Data Analysis, Momentum Strategies | Week 5 Coding Exercise for the applied portfolio management subject. The exercise explores momentum indicators and their analysis. It showcases the application of momentum strategies in the financial domain by calculating information coefficients and examining performance metrics. |
